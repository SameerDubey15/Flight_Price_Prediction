# Flight Price Prediction with Flask
This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques and provide a user-friendly web interface for users to input flight details and get price predictions. The project is implemented using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and various machine learning libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
2. Fill in the flight details such as source, destination, departure date, and other relevant information.
3. Click the "Predict" button.
4. The application will process the input and display the predicted flight price on the result page.

## Machine Learning Code
The machine learning code for training the flight price prediction model is not included in this repository. However, you can train your own model using any machine learning library or dataset of your choice. Once you have trained the model, save it as a serialized file (e.g., model.pkl) in the model/ directory.

In the Flask application (app.py), you can load the model using your preferred machine learning library and use it to make predictions based on the user input received through the web interface.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. The flight price predictions provided may not be accurate and should not be used for real-world financial decisions. The machine learning model's accuracy depends on the quality of the training data and the chosen algorithms. Always consult multiple sources and domain experts before making any significant financial decisions.
